## DSA---DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHM
A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.

### BINARY TREE
   A binary tree is a rooted tree that is also an ordered tree in which every node has at most two children
